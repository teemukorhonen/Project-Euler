/*
    This problem required no programming.
    The problem is simple, as only moving right of down is allowed. Thus there will be
    exactly 40 movements: 20 to right and 20 to down. There are 40 possible "places"
    for each down-movement, after we've laid out the movements to right.

    The solution then is simply 40-choose-20, or 137846528820.
